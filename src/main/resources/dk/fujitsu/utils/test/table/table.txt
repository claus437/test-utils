
1. Two tables side by side

! dimensions             !   ! expected       !
| width | length | depth |   | square | cubic |
|    10 |     20 |    30 |   |      6 |     6 |
|    11 |     21 |    31 |   |     20 |    40 |
|    12 |     22 |    32 |   |     10 |    15 |


2. Nested Objects

   The dimension holds a single object referring to the first row of the dimension table,
   while shape holds a list of all shapes defined in the shapes table.

! figures                           !
| id | dimension        | shapes    |
|  1 | ${dimensions[0]} | ${shapes} |


3. Merged tables

! extended_dimension    !
| ${dimension} | weight |
|            0 |     50 |
|            1 |     60 |
|            2 |     70 |


! shapes     !
| id | name  |
| 1  | Chair |
| 2  | Piano |
